## Hobbies:

- **Sketching and Drawing**
   - It's always suprising to realize how you can bring something to life from nothing with just your hands a little bit of creativity 
   - And however the hectic time, I can always find myself being relax when I have a pencil and a blank sheet in my hand.  
- **Playing Batminton** 
   - It's a great way to spend time with friends while also allowing my eyes to unwind from their constant exposure to devices.  
- **Reading**
   - There is a quote by one of my favourite author J.K. Rowling, 
   - "I do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book"
   - And That pretty much sums it up for me.
